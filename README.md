# Fake-Celebrity-Face-Generator-DCGAN

This GitHub repository contains a project that leverages a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate fake celebrity faces. The DCGAN model is a type of generative model that can create realistic-looking images by learning from a dataset of real images. In this project, we use a dataset of celebrity faces to train the DCGAN and produce lifelike, but entirely synthetic, celebrity portraits.
